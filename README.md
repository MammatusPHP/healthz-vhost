composer require reactive-apps/command-http-server
```

# Controllers

Controllers come in two different flavours static and instantiated controllers.

## Static Controllers

Static controllers are recommended when your controller doesn't have any dependencies like this ping controller used for
[`updown.io`](https://updown.io/r/rPWzd) health checks. ***Note: `/ping` isn't a updown standard but it's my personal
standard of doing health checks for my apps*** This controller only has a single method with a single route and no
dependencies:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Controller;

use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use ReactiveApps\Command\HttpServer\Annotations\Method;
use ReactiveApps\Command\HttpServer\Annotations\Routes;
use RingCentral\Psr7\Response;

final class Ping
{
    /**
     * @Method("GET")
     * @Routes("/ping")
     *
     * @param  ServerRequestInterface $request
     * @return ResponseInterface
     */
    public static function ping(ServerRequestInterface $request): ResponseInterface
    {
        return new Response(
            200,
            ['Content-Type' => 'text/plain'],
            'pong'
        );
    }
}
```

## Instantiated Controllers

Instantiated Controllers on the other hand will be instantiated and kept around to handle more requests in the future
as such they can have dependencies injected. The example below is a controller that has the event loop injected to wait
for a random number of seconds before returning the response. It also uses coroutines to make the code more readable:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Controller;

use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use React\EventLoop\LoopInterface;
use ReactiveApps\Command\HttpServer\Annotations\Method;
use ReactiveApps\Command\HttpServer\Annotations\Routes;
use ReactiveApps\Command\HttpServer\Annotations\Template;
use ReactiveApps\Command\HttpServer\TemplateResponse;
use WyriHaximus\Annotations\Coroutine;
use function WyriHaximus\React\timedPromise;

/**
 * @Coroutine())
 */
final class Root
{
    /** @var LoopInterface */
    private $loop;

    /** @var int */
    private $time;

    public function __construct(LoopInterface $loop)
    {
        $this->loop = $loop;
        $this->time = \time();
    }

    /**
     * @Method("GET")
     * @Routes("/")
     * @Template("root")
     *
     * @param  ServerRequestInterface $request
     * @return ResponseInterface
     */
    public function root(ServerRequestInterface $request)
    {
        $start = \time();

        yield timedPromise($this->loop, \random_int(1, 5));

        return (new TemplateResponse(
            200,
            ['Content-Type' => 'text/plain']
        ))->withTemplateData([
            'uptime' => (\time() - $this->time),
            'took' => (\time() - $start),
        ]);
    }
}

```

# Routing

Routing is done through annotations on the method handling the routes. Each method can handle multiple routes but it's
recommended to only map routes that fit the the method.

For example the following annotation will map the current method to `/` (***note: all routes are required to be
prefixed with `/`***): `@Routes("/")`

A multi route annotation has a slightly different syntax, in the following both `/old` and `/new` will be handled by
the same method:

```php
@Routes({
    "/old",
    "/new"
})
```

The underlying engine for routes is [`nikic/fast-route`](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute) which also makes complex
routes like this one possible:

```php
@Route("/{map:(?:wow_cata_draenor|wow_cata_land|wow_cata_underwater|wow_legion_azeroth|wow_battle_for_azeroth|wow_cata_elemental_plane|wow_cata_twisting_nether|wow_comp_wotlk)}/{zoom:1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10}/{width:[0-9]{1,5}}/{height:[0-9]{1,5}}/{center:[a-zA-Z0-9\`\-\~\_\@\%]{1,35}}{blips:/blip\_center|/[a-zA-Z0-9\`\-\~\_\@\%\[\]]{3,}.+|}.{quality:png|hq.jpg|lq.jpg}")
```

The different route components like `map`, and `center` are available from the request object with:

```php
$request->getAttribute('center');
```

# Templates

A route can render a template upon completion it needs an annotation and return/resolve with a `TemplateResponse`
holding the data required for that template. For example:

```php
/**
 * @Template("root")
 */
public function root(ServerRequestInterface $request)
{
    return (new TemplateResponse(
        200,
        ['Content-Type' => 'text/plain']
    ))->withTemplateData([
        'beer' => 'Allmouth', // https://untappd.com/user/WyriHaximus/checkin/745226210
    ]);
}
```

# Blocking operations in requests

While we aim for building a completely non-blocking application we can't escape the truth that there might always be
parts of our application that would block the loop. For those situations there are two ways provided to deal with those
situations:

* Child Process (slow, spawns full PHP processes to handle the request)
* Threads (fast, uses threads to do the work, requires ZTS version of PHP)

## Child Processes

Works on most if not all systems but requires a full PHP processes per worker. Start up can be slow and communication
with the child process goes over a socket. Add the `@ChildProcess` annotation to handle that specific action in a
child process.

## Threads

Works only on ZTS PHP builds, but in return starts up almost instantly, communication is directly in memory thus never
leaving the application server. Add the `@Thread` annotation to handle that specific action in a thread.

# Annotations

* `@ChildProcess` - Runs controller actions inside a child process
* `@Coroutine` - Runs controller actions inside a coroutine
* `@Method` - Allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, etc)
* `@Routes` - Routes to use the given method for
* `@Template` - Template to use when a TemplateResponse is used
* `@Thread` - Runs controller actions inside a thread (preferred over use child processes)

# Options

* `http-server.address` - The IP + Port to listen on, for example: `0.0.0.0:8080`
* `http-server.hsts` - Whether or not to set HSTS headers
* `http-server.public` - Public webroot to serve, note only put files in here everyone is allowed to see
* `http-server.public.preload.cache` - Custom cache to store the preloaded webroot files, stored in memory by default
* `http-server.middleware.prefix` - An array with react/http middleware added before the accesslog and webroot serving middleware
* `http-server.middleware.suffix` - An array with react/http middleware added after the accesslog and webroot serving middleware and before the route middleware and request handler
* `http-server.pool.ttl` - TTL for a child process to wait for it's next task
* `http-server.pool.min` - Minimum number of child processes
* `http-server.pool.max` - maximum number of child processes
* `http-server.rewrites` - Rewrites request path internally from one path to the other, invisible for visitors
